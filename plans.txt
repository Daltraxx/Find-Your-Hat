- have field start with undefined field dimensions, and throw errors for related methods when still undefined
- use hashmap for storing hole positions
- use gameGridSolvable to check predefined maps too
- have player and hat be minimumWidth apart
- only check predetermined set of times for solvable field before telling player to try populating less holes
- make tests for meetsEndConditions more specific on which endCondition was triggered
- have generateField automatically set gameGrid for instance(?)
